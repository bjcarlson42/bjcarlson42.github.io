Whether you are a developer, freelancer, photographer, designer, or something else, having an online presence is important. You need a way to show your work, gain clients, get yourself out there. A personal website is a great way to do this. In this article, I’ll talk about the must-haves in your website and look at examples from my own personal website.</p>\n<h2>Parts to Include</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of parts you should include in your website. Here are some of the most important parts. Keep in mind that these are in no specific order at all.</p>\n<h3>Captivating Landing Page</h3>\n<p>The first thing your visitor sees on your website is the landing page. Here are some important things you should include on your landing page. The first may seem obvious - your name. </p>\n<h4>Name</h4>\n<p>It may seem silly to even put this but I can’t tell you how many personal websites I find where I have to scroll to see the name of the individual who owns the website. Your name is the most important aspect of a personal brand so make sure you don’t forget to put your name. </p>\n<h4>Occupation</h4>\n<p>Second, you need to tell the user who you are and what you do. If you are a freelance photographer, they should know that just by looking at your landing page. Similarly to your name, the user should not have to search for what you do.</p>\n<h4>Able To Contact</h4>\n<p>Third, you should give the user a way to contact you. This can be done in a few ways on the landing page. The first way you can achieve this is by using social media links. This is what <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/\">I did with my website</a>. Without scrolling at all, you can get to my Instagram, Twitter, view my resume, send me an email, and more.  </p>\n<h4>Appealing</h4>\n<p>Lastly, make it look nice. The purpose of a landing page is to get the user excited to see more. To achieve this, you should really focus on the design of your landing page. Take a look at my landing page below.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/1d099/landing-page-min.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"landing page\"\n        title=\"landing page\"\n        src=\"/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/1c72d/landing-page-min.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/a80bd/landing-page-min.jpg 148w,\n/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/1c91a/landing-page-min.jpg 295w,\n/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/1c72d/landing-page-min.jpg 590w,\n/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/a8a14/landing-page-min.jpg 885w,\n/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/fbd2c/landing-page-min.jpg 1180w,\n/static/fd847313024e87c4f862a1a5cb14fbd4/1d099/landing-page-min.jpg 3276w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>As you can see in the image above, all four things I mentioned above are incorporated. I used a minimalistic design but that is just one way to do it!</p>\n<h3>Personal Blog</h3>\n<p>This is a great way to show potential employers that you are actually interested in your field. Writing regularly shows that you are always learning, staying up to date, and enjoying what you do. It is also a great way to show that you know how to communicate effectively through writing - an important soft skill for any industry. However, you need to be sure that you keep this blog updated. You don’t want the last post to be from three years ago because then people coming to your website might think the entire site is out of date! You also need to make sure your writing isn’t riddled with grammatical errors of false information. That’s just a red flag to employers. While you’re here, check out the <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/blog/\">home page of my blog</a> and let me know what you think!</p>\n<h3>Your Best Projects</h3>\n<p>This should be one of the most important parts of your website. After all, if you are a freelancer or simply looking for a job, clients and employers need to know that you have done quality work in the past. There is no better way to show this to them by putting some actual examples of your best work on your website. Here are some guidelines I recommend following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>4 - 6 projects is ideal.</strong> Don’t put every project you have ever done on your website. Clients don’t need to see everything you have done over your career. It’s just too much and chances are some of those projects aren’t that good. It is important to only show your best projects on your website.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep project description simple.</strong> You don’t need to write an essay about what each project is. Short and sweet is the way to go. For example, if you are a web designer and you have 4 websites you want to show in your projects section, maybe put a picture of it with a brief title and include a button where the client can view the website live. This is much better than including multiple screenshots of the website and a long summary of what it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Link to live project.</strong> If the project is a website or something that the user can interact with, link to it! Letting the user actually use your product is a lot better than a description or even some pictures.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Experience</h3>\n<p>Another important part in your personal website is your past experience. If you have a great history pleasing clients as a freelance photographer and have been doing it for years, this gives you the upper hand over someone who only has one year of experience. Similarly, if you have a resume website and you are applying for a job that requires you to program in <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/python/programming/tutorial/2019/11/20/learn-python-variables-comments-and-data-types-tutorial-2.html\">Python</a>, putting a job you worked for 10 years where you programmed in Python makes you stand out.</p>\n<h3>About Section</h3>\n<p>There are multiple ways to add an about section on your website. You can have the about section be its own individual page or if your website is only one page, it might be a short section. Regardless of what you choose, make sure to keep it simple. A headline and a paragraph or two is all you need. Avoid telling your life story. This is too much info for your website and doesn’t increase your chances of getting a job or a client. A picture of yourself isn’t even necessary. Adding a picture may seem like a harmless thing but it can lean to biases against you. What you look should not be a factor in getting a job so don’t put a picture of yourself on your website. For example, on my website, I have an about section which has a brief summary about myself and a short timeline of my life. It is not lot of info but that is by design.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/fd329/about-section-min.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 22.972972972972975%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"about section\"\n        title=\"about section\"\n        src=\"/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/1c72d/about-section-min.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/a80bd/about-section-min.jpg 148w,\n/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/1c91a/about-section-min.jpg 295w,\n/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/1c72d/about-section-min.jpg 590w,\n/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/a8a14/about-section-min.jpg 885w,\n/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/fbd2c/about-section-min.jpg 1180w,\n/static/7cae0f1fb6e531b275dbc6389f5f8072/fd329/about-section-min.jpg 2860w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Testimonials</h3>\n<p>If you are selling a service this is an important section. It shows potential clients that you have had satisfied clients in the past. This will make clients more likely to hire you for their project. Similarly to the projects, you don’t need an overwhelming number of testimonials. Any number from 2 to 5 is a good amount. If clients are interested in your service and they want more testimonials than what is on your website, you can always put them in contact with past clients.</p>\n<h3>Contact Section</h3>\n<p>You need a way for potential clients or anyone else to send you a message. The easiest way to do this is to have a contact page or a section of your website dedicated for a contact section. A good way to go is to have a form that a user can fill out to easily send you a message. If you are a freelancer you might have the option for the customer to put their price range and/or project details. Here is a good example. Here are some important items to include in your contact section:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Social media links</li>\n<li>Phones number</li>\n<li>Hours of operation (if applicable)</li>\n<li>Contact email</li>\n<li>Where you are located (if applicable)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My website doesn’t have a dedicated contact section but I do have many ways to reach out to me scattered throughout the entire website. The landing page has all of my social links, there is an area that <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/#intro\">prompts the user to email me</a>, and the user can easily navigate to this blog website which has more social buttons.</p>\n<h3>Fast Load Time</h3>\n<p>The average user will <a href=\"https://www.websitemagazine.com/blog/5-reasons-visitors-leave-your-website\">leave a website after 3 seconds</a>{:target=”<em>blank”} if it does not load. Website creators need to keep this in mind when creating a website. Your website could have great information but if the user gets aggravated and leaves before the page loads, that helps no one! One way to avoid this is to choose a good web hosting company. I use <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/\">Siteground web hosting</a>{:target=”</em>blank”} and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants an affordable, fast hosting option. </p>\n<p>Update: I no longer use Siteground as my hosting service. I am now using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. This is completely free unless you purchase a domain name and opt to host your site with that name. This is what I did and it costs me 10 dollars a year. Some pros of using a static site generator like Jekyll are its faster and more secure!</p>\n<p>Another way to improve load time is in the code. Some technical tips to improve load time are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Minify CSS and JS files (you can do this easily in Wordpress)</li>\n<li>Write cleaner code</li>\n<li>Use less CSS and JS files</li>\n<li>Optimize images</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>But I’m not a web Developer!</h2>\n<p>If you don’t have a coding background don’t worry. There are many ways you can create a great personal website without writing a single line of code. You can…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hire a freelancer (I freelance! Reach out and I’d love to build your new website!).</li>\n<li>Use Wordpress and build it yourself.</li>\n<li>Get a website template online, custimize it, and host it yourself</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you include all of these parts in your personal website, I promise you will see results.
