It has always been a dream of mine to share things I am passionate about with the\nworld. I am finally taking that dream and turning it into a reality by starting this website. As you read through this post, you will learn more about me, my experiences, and what you, the reader, will get out of this site.\nI hope you enjoy!</p>\n<h2>About Me</h2>\n<p>First things first, let me introduce myself. My name is Benjamin Carlson. I am currently a sophomore at\nBryant\nUniversity in Smithfield, RI pursuing a degree in Data Science with a minor in Business Administration.\nI grew up in\nMiddletown, Connecticut and I am one of three other siblings. Growing up, I played a lot of sports\nincluding\nbaseball,\nsoccer, basketball, cross country, and track.</p>\n<h3>High School</h3>\n<p>In high school I was very active, joining many organizations both inside and outside of school. I was a\nmember of\nmarching, concert, and jazz band, cross country, indoor and outdoor track, pride leaders, and co-founder of\nthe cubing\nclub. Outside of school I was a part of my church’s Peer Ministry group and Boy Scouts where I earned the\nprestigious\nrank of Eagle Scout.</p>\n<h3>College</h3>\n<p>In college I run Division 1 cross country and track, played in the pep band, and am part of the Data Science\nAssociation. If you would rather see a visual timeline of my history, check out the about section of my\nwebsite or the\nabout section of this website!</p>\n<h2>Coding Experience</h2>\n<p>Because this website will be all about coding (and the world around it), it’s important that you know that\nthe person\nteaching you how to code is knowledgeable and knows what they are doing. So before we go any further, here\nis some of my\nprogramming experience.</p>\n<p>I took my first Computer Science class senior year of high school. I instantly fell in love and have been\nprogramming\nconstantly since then. Some of the classes I have taken (or am taking now) include Infrastructure and Cloud\nComputing,\nWeb Design and Development (Honors), Applied Analytics (Data Science focus), Introduction to Programming,\nProgramming\nfor Analytics, Statistics 1, Statistics 2, Calculus 1, and SAS Programming. I have also taught myself over\nthe past year\nor so web design and development. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and some web frameworks all during my free\ntime.</p>\n<h3>Computer Science Internships</h3>\n<p>Along with these classes I also have two internships under my belt, both in the computer science field. The\nfirst was an\nI.T. internship for my town’s City Hall. Here my main tasks were to secure disposal of hard drives and other\nelectronics, remove security cameras, printers and electronic inventory, and respond to City Hall Worker’s\nI.T. related\nquestions.</p>\n<p>The following summer I had the opportunity to intern at The Law Forum LLC. Here I worked with the software\ndevelopment\nteam to generate reports using C# linq queries, updated existing sites using git for version control, worked\nclosely\nwith their database using SQL queries, and oversaw website development from start to finish from a technical\nand\nbusiness standpoint. As you can see from this, I have a pretty extensive knowledge base.</p>\n<h3>I’m Mostly Self Taught</h3>\n<p>As a self taught programmer myself, I have picked up lots of tips and tricks along the way. I have also done\nsome things\nthat looking back, was not the best way to go about doing it. I hope to share these good practices along\nwith the\nmistakes with you so you can have the best self taught programming experience possible.</p>\n<h2>The Future of This Website</h2>\n<p>Enough about me, let’s look at where I plan to take this site. My goal is to post weekly. These posts could\nbe coding\ntutorials, computer science related news, or something else. Regarding the tutorials, they will start off as\nbeginner\ntutorials. For anyone who many not be a beginner, don’t worry. The tutorials will get challenging (and\nexciting) fast!</p>\n<h3>Why Should you Code</h3>\n<p>In this day and age, everything from video games, driving to work, and even taking a hot shower is powered\nby code.\nKnowing how to code is beginning to switch from an option to a necessity. Learning how to code is important\nin so many\nways but here are three reasons to learn.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Knowing how to code makes you stand out to employees. If you are a college student, every person that you\nare\ncompeting with for a job has a decent GPA and some extracurriculars. You need a way to stand out to\nemployers. Knowing\nhow to code is a great way! Creating personal projects and showing employers that you have the motivation\nand drive to\nlearn on your own is a great way to show companies that you will flourish at their company. If you’re not a\ncollege\nstudent, it’s still a great way to stand out from your co-workers!</li>\n<li>You can build whatever app, website, or program you have ever dreamed of building for free. Have you ever\nhad an idea\nfor a mobile game that you couldn’t make a reality because you didn’t have the money to hire someone to make\nit for you\nand you didn’t know how to code it yourself? Following along with my tutorials will give you the skills to\nmake that app\nor even the next big tech startup!</li>\n<li>Coding is fun! Learning how to code will not only make you a better candidate for any job, it’s also fun.\nThe only\nway to learn something well is to have fun doing it. If you enjoy learning to code you are already ahead of\nmost.\nBecause of this philosophy, I am going to try and make these tutorials as fun as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>More Than Tutorials</h3>\n<p>Knowing how to code isn’t all that this website will offer. There is so much happening in this world today\nthat is\nrelated to computer science but does not require knowing code to understand, which is why along with coding\ntutorials I\nalso plan to post about a variety of things computer science related. Some topics that interest me and that\nI could post\nabout are data science, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and self driving cars just to name a few.</p>\n<h2>Why Python?</h2>\n<p>Hopefully at this point you are getting excited about learning how to code and you may be asking what\nlanguage we will\nlearn first? If you do a quick google search of “What’s the best programming language to learn first” you\nwill find a\nton on overwhelming results. If you read through them you will find that the answers vary tremendously.\nThere is no one\nbest coding language to learn first. You can make good arguments for some of them but at the end of the day\nit doesn’t\nreally matter.</p>\n<p>This is why when choosing a language to learn, I tried to think of the language that would give you the most\nbang for\nyour buck. I didn’t have to think long to come up with a language. The language I will start teaching you\nfirst is\nPython. You have probably heard of Python before as it has been a big buzzword for quite some time now.</p>\n<h3>Uses of Python</h3>\n<p>When I wanted to start a coding website for beginners this was the first language that came to mind for a\nfew reasons.\nFirst, it is not hard to learn. You can write your first Python program and understand basic syntax in a\nmatter of\nminutes! Second, it has endless applications. Analytics? Yes. Web Design? Yes. Mobile App Development? Yes.\nData\nScience? Of course (this is arguably its main application).</p>\n<p>One web framework, called Django, uses Python and Instagram is built on the Django framework! As you can\ntell, Python is\na hot, in-demand language and is going nowhere soon. Learning Python will allow you to build so many things\nand\nunderstand so many computer science concepts and it won’t take that long to learn.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up!</h2>\n<p>With all this said, I hope you all are as excited as I am to go on this journey and to begin or continue\nlearning how to\ncode. Be sure to sign up for my newsletter to be notified when a new post comes out and follow me on\nlinkedIn, Github,\nFacebook, Twitter, and Instagram! See you all in the next post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why You Need To Be Able To Code: And A Little About Me","date":"October 08, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about-me copy 3/about-me/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me copy 3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why You Need To Be Able To Code: And A Little About Me"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why You Need To Be Able To Code: And A Little About Me"}}}}}
