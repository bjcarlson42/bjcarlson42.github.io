There were so many different technologies out there and finding the right one for the job sometimes seemed impossible. If you wanted to make a clone of Instagram (or any social media app) how would you build it? What framework would you use (if any)? What database? How would you connect the two? What language would you write the app in? These are only some of the questions that you will ask yourself before eventually going down a rabbit hole of learning so many different technologies yet mastering none of them.</p>\n<p>{% include under-p1-ad.html %}</p>\n<p>It is easy to get stuck at this stage so that is why I have decided to make this “cheat sheet” with a bunch of different programming related technologies and what they are best used for so you never have to be stuck again. Using a combination of these tools is how all websites, apps, and programs are built, including well known sites like Facebook and Instagram. The goal of this is to be a “cheat sheet” or a reference page. Each technology will have a short snippet detailing what it is. This is not meant to be a tutorial on each technology. It is up to you which ones you want to continue learning.</p>\n<h2>GitHub Student Developer Pack</h2>\n<p>Before I begin with this article, I want to let you guys know of an awesome free pack by GitHub. We will talk about GitHub later in this post but they offer a <a href=\"https://education.github.com/pack\">free student developer pack</a>{:target=“_blank”} that gives you access to a lot of tools and services. Some of these services are free to begin with but others cost money. If you are a student I strongly encourage you to check this out. A lot of the tools I will be talking about today are offered in this pack.</p>\n<h2>Programming Languages</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/programming-languages-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<p>A programming language is a way that humans can give directions to a computer in a way that the computer understands. The part of the language that the computer understands is “binary”.  When a language is “compiled” it is translated into binary. Here are some of the most well known and most used (and in demand) programming languages.</p>\n<h3>C</h3>\n<p>C is a procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie all the way back in 1972. It is good for operator and compiler development. Java, PHP, and JavaScripts syntax’s are based a lot on that of C. It is a powerful and efficient object oriented language but has a low level of abstraction.</p>\n<h3>C++</h3>\n<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is an extension of the C programming language. It is a powerful language and is used for systems programming but unlike C, it easier to use in more powerful ways. Because it is a compiled language, C++ has a lot of speed.</p>\n<h3>Objective-C</h3>\n<p>This general-purpose, object-oriented programming language was designed by Brad Cox. It is easy to learn if you know another Object Oriented language like Java.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift, is a new iOS programming language, announced by Apple in June, 2014. This language was created in order to replace Objective-C, however Swift is capable of working alongside Objective-C. Swift is a lot faster than Objective-C and at the end of the day, will replace Objective-C for good.</p>\n<h3>Java</h3>\n<p>Java is an object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Can be used in web applications as a backend language as well as used for programming Android Mobile Applications. It was developed to be fairly easy to write, compile, and debug. It is also the default choice for scientific applications such as natural language processing.</p>\n<h3>C</h3>\n<p>This language was developed by Microsoft. It is almost a complete copy of Java, and therefore if you know Java, you basically know C#. Some important characteristics in C# are its LINQ queries that allow you to work with a database easily writing SQL like commands in C#.</p>\n<h3>Ruby</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruby is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the 1990’s. It is used with the Ruby on Rails Framework - very popular web framework. Like C# it has some similarities to Java but one major difference is that Java is a compiled language while Ruby is a scripting language - similar to Python. </p>\n<h3>Python</h3>\n<p>Python is a language you have probably heard a lot of lately as it has been a “buzzword” for some time now. Python is a high level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It is used for many things including web development (with Django), data science (NumPy, Pandas and other libraries), natural langauge processing, and much more. <strong>If you are looking for a language to learn late 2019 into 2020, this is my pick</strong>.</p>\n<h3>PHP</h3>\n<p>Similar to Python, PHP is a general purpose language which was initially created for web development. It is the code behind WordPress (along with MySQL), the worlds biggest content management system for websites. So, if you are looking to learn WordPress, this might be the language for you.</p>\n<h2>Front End Programming Languages</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/web-design-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<p>Font end programming languages are languages that hold the content of a webpage. This includes the text, images, and styling. These languages are fairly easy to learn as they are not technically programming languages.</p>\n<h3>HTML</h3>\n<p>Hypertext Markup Language or HTML, is not technically a programming language, rather a markup language. It is used to marking up a web page and formatting the words, pictures, and links. It can’t do much by itself but it provides to underlying structure to websites.</p>\n<h3>CSS</h3>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, are what make websites look the way the do. CSS provides colors, fonts, layout, animations, and much more to websites. CSS is what is used for a companies branding and is an important aspect to user experience.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Not to be confused with Java, JavaScript is an interpreted language that is used to make web pages dynamic. It allows for validation, improves the design of the webpage, validate forms, detect browsers, create cookies, and much more. If you are not sure if JavaScript is right for you, check out a tutorial I did on <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/javascript/programming/web%20development/technology/2019/12/10/client-side-form-validation-in-javascript.html\">validating forms with JavaScript</a>.</p>\n<h2>Web Frameworks</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/web-design-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<p>Web Frameworks take the complexity of a website and “hide” a lot of the things behind the scenes. They make the development of a website easier. Almost all sites today use some sort of framework, even if it just a basic front end framework.</p>\n<h3>.NET</h3>\n<p>The .NET Framework, built by Microsoft is a heavy weight web Framework. One of its more common ones if MVC, which stands for model (data), view (what the user sees), and controller (the brains). It uses Microsoft’s C# programming language and runs on windows machines best.</p>\n<h3>Django</h3>\n<p>The Django framework is the first web framework I learned. It uses Python, which allows for a super fast and efficient framework. Some of the worlds biggest social media companies use Django including Instagram.</p>\n<h3>Angular</h3>\n<p>Angular is a front end web framework maintained by Google. It is sometimes referred to as AngularJS and is used to build mobile and desktop UIs.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<p>React is a similar to Angular in that it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is maintained by Facebook. One of its pros is fetching fast changing data and recording it.</p>\n<h2>Databases</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/data-center-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<h3>SQL</h3>\n<p>Developed by Microsoft, this database management engine runs on cloud based servers as well as local servers. It is very fast and very stable and works well with other Microsoft based products such as .NET and C#. When used as an enterprise application, it can get pricey.</p>\n<h3>MySQL</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A very popular database choice for web based applications. It is free, offers a lot of functionality, and updates are released regularly.</span></p>\n<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>\n<p>Another free database which is commonly used in Web Applications. One of the pros of this database management engine is that it is highly scalable and can handle terabytes of data.</p>\n<h3>MongoDB</h3>\n<p>A free database designed for applications that use both structured and unstructured data. Like the previous Databases, MongoDB is very fast and easy to use. One possible downfall is that SQL is not used as a query language so there may be a learning curve to this database.</p>\n<h2>Text Editor’s and IDE’s</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/ide-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<h3>Atom</h3>\n<p>Atom is a free, open-source text editor developed by GitHub. It is cross platform and has great support via plugins for Git control and web development. I used this text editor for a long time (before it crashed and refused to open).</p>\n<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>\n<p>This is my current IDE of choice. Like Atom, it offers many plugins for different languages and technologies. It works well for web development and my <a href=\"https://benjamincarlson.net/\">personal website</a> was build using only VSCode.</p>\n<h3>Visual Studio</h3>\n<p>Visual Studio is similar to Visual Studio Code. It works best on a Microsoft machine but does have a mac version. If you are developing using C# and .NET, this is definitely your editor of choice.</p>\n<h3>PyCharm</h3>\n<p>PyCharm is a good IDE when using the Python programming language. It was developed by JetBrains. JetBrains offers many other services like Sublime text and IntellJ IDEA. A downside is that these platforms are not free.</p>\n<h3>Android Studio</h3>\n<p>If you are an Android app developer, this is a great IDE for you. It offers great support for xml, Java, and other languages related to android development. I used android studio a lot in high school and even have <a href=\"https://github.com/bjcarlson42/high-school-code/tree/master/android-studio\">some projects on my GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Eclipse</h3>\n<p>This is another great choice for an IDE. Similar to PyCharm, it offers extensive plugins and an extremely customizable coding environment. Eclipse, however, is free!</p>\n<h2>Git</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/git-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<h3>GitHub</h3>\n<p>This is the most well known platform for Git. So much so that people often think Git and GitHub are the same thing. GitHub provides hosting for software development version control using Git. GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.</p>\n<h3>Azure Devops</h3>\n<p>Azure DevOps is a version controlled system developed by Microsoft. Some features it offers are automated builds, lab management and testing.</p>\n<h2>Web Hosting Services</h2>\n<span class=\"blog-post-imbedded-img\">\n![](https://benjamincarlson.net/assets/img/posts/8-what-coding-technology-should-you-learn/web-hosting-min.jpg)\n</span>\n<h3>AWS</h3>\n<p>Amazon Web Services is a cloud service application developed by Amazon. It provides services to individuals and companies alike. They offer different cloud hosting plans including a pay fro what you use plan.</p>\n<h3>Siteground</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/recommended?referrer_id=8153630\">Siteground</a> is what I currently use and is what this website is hosted on. Some of the services Siteground offers are shared hosting, cloud hosting and dedicated servers.</p>\n<p>Update: I am no longing using Siteground to host this webiste. I am using Jekyll and GitHub pages.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Azure</h3>\n<p>This is yet another service developed by Microsoft. This is a cloud hosting service where users can build, test and deploy their apps. All servers are run and managed by Microsoft.</p>\n<h3>Heroku</h3>\n<p>Heroku is another cloud platform to deploy your web apps to. It was developed in 2007 and was one of the first cloud platforms. This is one of the many services offered in the GitHub student pack.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I hope this provides you with a good starting point to what makes up the web and gives you ideas for further research!
